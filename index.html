                A food desert is when 33% or more of the population is located more than 
                1 mile (in urban areas) or 15 miles (in rural areas) from the nearest 
                supermarket or grocery store.

              <li>
                Minority populations are more likely to live within food deserts or food 
                insecure areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                The cause comes from the lasting effects of segregational practices in the United States.

                “White Flight”, started in the 1950s and 1960s. The “white flight” defines the sudden widespread
                 movement of white individuals to more racially homogeneous areas from mixed race areas.

              </li>
              <li>
                Redlining, popular between 1945 and 1959. Redlining refers to the practice of withholding services
                from areas that are depicted as “high risk”, which include minority groups and low-income individuals. 

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    While redlining is now illegal, it still has lasting effects.

                "White flight” and redlining have created food apartheid.

                Food apartheid is a systematic injustice that impacts food access.

              <li>
                It is directly related to the creation of food insecurity.

              <li>
                In these affected areas, vacant storefronts are prominent.

                  <li>
                    In low income areas, many cannot afford rising rent rates and make a profit.

                As a case study, we can look at New York City. NYC has seen a shift in the racial 
                populations as a result of both “White Flight” and redlining in the 1950s.
              </li>
              <li>
                New York City has seen a rise in vacant storefronts, 4.38% from 2019 to 2020.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    As incomes decrease, storefront vacancy increases.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Also in New York City, food deserts are prominent.

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    More than 750,000 NYC residents live within a food desert.

                </ul>

            <ul>

                Within these food deserts, many people have their own gardens.

                    Government funding and agricultural educational programs have 
                    the opportunity to incentivize and expand on this.
